I am a PhD student in the Tangram (previously Magrit) team at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) in Nancy. I am supervised by [Marie-Odile Berger](https://members.loria.fr/MOBerger/) and [Gilles Simon](https://members.loria.fr/GSimon/). My general areas of interest are computer vision, machine learning and augmented reality. My research focuses on visual localization.

Before starting my PhD, I have worked for 2 years at [Kitware](https://www.kitware.fr/), as a computer vision engineer. I wrote my Master Thesis at [SICK IVP](https://www.sick.com/se/en/), supervised by [Ola Friman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C2J33ewAAAAJ&hl=en), on Super-resolution for
Time-of-flight Cameras. I received a French Engineering degree from the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr/) and a MSc from [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en), Sweden, both in Computer Science. I have also spent 6 months as an exchange student at [Technische Universität Chemnitz](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en) in Germany.
