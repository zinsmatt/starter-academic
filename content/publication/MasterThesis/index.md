abstract: The recent emergence of time-of-flight cameras has opened up new possibilities in the world of computer vision. These compact sensors, capable of recording the depth of a scene in real-time, are very advantageous in many applications, such as scene or object reconstruction. This thesis first addresses the problem of fusing depth data with color images. A complete process to combine a time-of-flight camera with a color camera is described and its accuracy is evaluated. The results show that a satisfying precision is reached and that the step of calibration is very important. The second part of the work consists of applying super-resolution techniques to the time-of-flight camera in order to improve its low resolution. Different types of super-resolution algorithms exist but this thesis focuses on the combination of multiple shifted depth maps. The proposed framework is made of two steps, registration and reconstruction. Different methods for each step are tested and compared according to the improvements reached in term of level of details, sharpness and noise reduction. The results obtained show that Lucas-Kanade performs the best for the registration and that a non-uniform interpolation gives the best results in term of reconstruction. Finally, a few suggestions are made about future work and extensions for our solutions.
